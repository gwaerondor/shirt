# Shirt
When I went on a business trip to Finland, my colleagues gave me a super cool Erlang shirt.
This repo contains an implementation of the shirt.

## Sounds like a riddle...
Here's the shirt.

It has a weird string at the end, ```M$8xU=c_ux5=ux;=u_x8[```, which probably is the output of a certain string that has been encrypted with this algorithm. So I guess the only thing to do is to write a function that decrypts it...
